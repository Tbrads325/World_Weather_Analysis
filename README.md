# World_Weather_Analysis
## Challenge 6

This challenge had us complete 3 seperate deliverables. The first included creating a weather database to use in
later analysis by randomly selecting 2000 longitude and latitude point. The next deliverable had us create a vacation
search tool similar to the one created in the module. This tool would allow someone to filter the locations based on temperature
and if a hotel was located in the vicinity. Finally, the third deliverable tasked us with creating a trip route through 4 different
cities using the database that was created in deliverable 2.
